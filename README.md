## About

Understanding changes in vegetation cover is crucial for environmental monitoring, conservation efforts, and assessing the impact of climate change and human activities. This project aims to provide an automated and scalable approach to vegetation change analysis, enabling researchers, policymakers, and land managers to make informed decisions.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Temporal Analysis:** Utilizes satellite imagery from different time periods (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) to track changes in vegetation cover.
* **Machine Learning-Based:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, deep learning) for accurate change detection and classification.
* **Spatial Analysis:** Identifies not only the extent of change but also the spatial patterns and distribution of change across the landscape.
* **Interpretable Results:** Generates maps, statistics, and visualizations that clearly communicate the nature and magnitude of vegetation changes.

## Data Sources

* **Satellite Imagery:**  Multi-spectral imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, or other suitable sources.
* **Reference Data:**  Optional ground truth data for model validation and accuracy assessment.
* **Ancillary Data:** Potentially incorporates additional data like elevation models, climate variables, or land-use maps for enhanced analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Atmospheric correction, cloud masking, and geometric registration of satellite imagery.
   - Calculation of vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) to quantify vegetation greenness.
2. **Change Detection:**
   - Comparison of vegetation indices or spectral bands from different time periods.
   - Application of change detection algorithms (e.g., image differencing, change vector analysis).
3. **Classification (Optional):**
   - If desired, classification of change types (e.g., deforestation, regrowth) using machine learning models.
4. **Post-Processing:**
   - Smoothing and filtering to refine change maps.
   - Accuracy assessment and validation using reference data.

## Results

Showcase your change analysis results here:
* **Change Maps:** Visualizations of detected changes in vegetation cover.
* **Statistics:**  Quantification of change magnitude and area statistics for different categories.
* **Accuracy Assessment:**  Report the accuracy of change detection and classification results.
